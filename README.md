## Coding Questions and Fizzbuzz

When you want to get a job in CS, some companies do technical interviews in which they ask you coding questions. They are hard to master and can be a nerve-racking experience. Not only do you need to know what you are talking about, but you also have to prove it to the person interviewing you. Fortunately, most fears of failure in this regard are exaggerated, and you will be able to solve most of the questions with basic data structure and algorithm understanding plus some experience with a specific programming language.

One of the most basic coding questions ever is FizzBuzz. It is a word game designed for children to teach them about division. In the game, each number divisible by three will be returned with a Fizz and any number divisible by five will return a Buzz. If it is divisible by both you return a FizzBuzz. Anybody who is able to code should be able to come up with a solution to this.

## Solution

I have provided the solution to FizzBuzz. I would like anybody new to coding questions to take an approach and time to solve this problem. After a while, you can look at the file `fizzbuzz.py` in this repository for my solution to this problem.
